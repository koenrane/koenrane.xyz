# Setup

Run `git config core.hooksPath .hooks` to use the repo's hooks. To [verify that one of my commits was produced at a given date](https://turntrout.com/design#finishing-touches), you need to check out another repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/alexander-turner/.timestamps
cd .timestamps
ots --no-bitcoin verify "files/$full_commit_hash.txt.ots" 
```

The above `ots` ([Open Timestamp](https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-client/blob/master/README.md)) command is written assuming you don't have a local copy of the blockchain and are instead willing to trust external calendar services. The commit times can be inspected zero-trust by downloading the blockchain and removing `--no-bitcoin`.

[^python]: Python testing and type-checking are run locally and not on GitHub actions.
