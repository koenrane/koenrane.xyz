*This page describes the intent for this website, how I find my ideas, site content, how I organize information, why I write, and all technical aspects of the site*

On this site, my hope for the content is to offer my informed take on various subjects that involve programming, philosophy, biology, self-experiments, psychology, economics, AI, and some musings on practical life.

> *All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.*

 The extent of my existing writing spans several years. Still, it is a hodge-podge of unfinished essays, a massive amount of densely linked notes in roam, journal entries, and archived Substack articles. Three years ago, I created a website similar to this one to write there exclusively, but my capacity for implementing and managing a website was very minimal. I soon dropped that project but continued to write in small chunks on various topics that I found interesting. Here, I hope to expand those writings into more long-form pages with a more intentional approach to research and writing.

For as long as I can remember, I have been a voracious reader. Early on, the majority of my reading was in the science fiction genre, with some sprinklings of biographies and history books. My reading sections have always been explicitly curated (even when I was young) to what I am obsessed with at the moment. There are rare moments when I pursue some tangent after stumbling across an esoteric book, but for the most part, my book selections match my current interests. The hope for this site is to continue my current modus operandi, but in a more intentional way that supports the content.  

The intent here is to post long-form essays that stem from my research and reading to offer novel (hopefully) ideas and opinions on subjects that I find important and address the ever-present rabbit holes that I find myself in. I enjoy the thrill of delving into a new rabbit hole, which give that particular subject quite a strong hold over my cognitive bandwidth. Even so, I find [[https://open.substack.com/pub/dwarkesh/p/gwern-branwen?selection=e3c5da5e-6b75-449f-9916-810e8a8e5c28&utm_campaign=post-share-selection&utm_medium=web | rabbit holes]] to be one of the many enjoyments of my particular personality.
