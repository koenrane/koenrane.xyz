I am an independent researcher and writer who explores topics that encompass AI, programming, philosophy, biology, self-experimentation, psychology, economics, meditation, and practical life. My hope for this site is to turn years worth of notes into long-form essays. I am also currently writing fictional short stories.

The *[About Site](/about-site)* page provides information about this website's design, philosophy, writing intent, and how I research. For information about myself, see the *[About Me](/about)* page. To see site changes, project updates, and general notes on progress, see the *[Changelog](/changelog)* page. For website features, design, and implementation, see the *[Design page](/design)*
