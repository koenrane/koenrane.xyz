- inserted right-padding to wiki-text in [[https://github.com/koenrane/koenrane.xyz/blob/main/pub/skins/pmwiki-responsive/skin.css | skin.css]] to make paragraphs more readable.

- created Fiction section on the home page and added the first chapter of my longstanding fictional novel. ''"The Oneiroi's Subject"'' is a working title and will possibly change at the end. As of March 2025, there are 11 Chapters, all in different states of completion (is any writing ever completed?)
