# 2025

---

### NOVEMBER

---

- [So You Want To Run Your Own AI Stack?](/full-local-ai) - Completed essay
- Transclusion improvements:
  - Popover behavior: Added sandboxed iframe previews for external links via `quartz/components/scripts/popover.inline.ts` with load/error handling and position updates. Provided text-summary fallback (`external-preview-frame--fallback`).
  - Styles (`quartz/components/styles/popover.scss`): New external popover layout: `popover-inner--external`, header, and iframe container styles.
  - Tests (`quartz/components/tests/popover.spec.ts`): Updated external-link hover test to expect sandboxed iframe. Added failure-path test asserting fallback rendering when iframe load is blocked.



### OCTOBER

---

- [Chapter 3](https://koenrane.xyz/os-chapter-3) of Onieroi's Subject

### JULY

---

- added content to [Book Reviews](/book-reviews) - Silo Series
- added spacing elements in book review titles between link, author, and star rankings plus other small formatting errors. 
- new essay: [Four Years of Whoop](/4-years-of-whoop)
- new essay: [Essay Writing with LLMS Affects Cognition](/brain-on-chatgpt)
- pmwiki site was completely refactored into a quartz SSG. Previous host server on DigitalOcean was sunset, archived, and shut down. Code files for pmwiki on Github were archived and replaced with Quartz infrastructure and content files, then pulled to local. An instance on Cloudflare was setup, and the domain hosting was transferred there. The first production build was pushed from remote to Cloudflare server to initialize the project and the site was successfully loaded in the browser. An R2 instance was setup for asset hosting and all images were transferred to assets.koenrane.xyz.
- Numerous formatting and aesthetic adjustments were made to reflect the desired initial look of the site.

### JUNE

---

- [The Oneiroi's Subject](/the-oneirois-subject)
- [Tea Reviews](/tea-reviews)
- [Book Reviews](/book-reviews)

## OLD SITE

- inserted right-padding to wiki-text in [[https://github.com/koenrane/koenrane.xyz/blob/main/pub/skins/pmwiki-responsive/skin.css | skin.css]] to make paragraphs more readable. On mobile, the paragraphs were too close to the edge of the screen, which made it difficult to read. On desktop, the right margin size is similar to the left giving the page more symmetry. 
- adjusted max import file size limit to 300KB
- reformatted About Me and About Site page section titles
- created Fiction section on the home page and added the first chapter of my longstanding fictional novel. ''"The Oneiroi's Subject"'' is a working title and will possibly change at the end.
