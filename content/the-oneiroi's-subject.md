A story about a troubled researcher, dreams, and how death brings change

# SYNOPSIS
---
This story follows a once-renowned researcher through his life after the recent death of his wife. He is stricken with grief, and everything around him seems to be moving at an inexplicable pace. He has just finished a year-long sabbatical during which he mourned the loss of his wife. Now, amid an ongoing inquiry from the Research Ethics committee, he is forced to rely on his friends around him for help as he deals with an internal investigation of his team's research, led by someone with ulterior motives. If their research produces something successful, it could be what he needs to propel him out of his desperate situation. Increasingly frustrated by the state of everything around him, he attempts to bury himself in his research but is consistently pulled away by memories of the past three years, with the person he still loves. As he lives each day alone, in an empty house, he begins to notice things that remind him of what life used to be. He is reminded of the decisions he made in the past, the ones he should have made, and the way of life he took for granted. This loneliness brings clarity and focus to the world around him. Even amidst this clarity, his dreams become extremely vivid and begin to affect his waking life. The world of his dreams begins to collide with his grasp of reality. In his grief, through his observations of the familiar world around him, new information comes to light that changes his perspective.
